## Image registration with mutual information estimation

This repo is intended for assignment submission for CMPUT617 @ University of Alberta

Instructor: [Nilanjan Ray](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/)

Question 1: See [version 1](https://github.com/stwklu/cmput617/blob/master/assignment2/assignment2_v1.ipynb). This version has been tuned to yield decent performence.

Question 2&3: See [version 2](https://github.com/stwklu/cmput617/blob/master/assignment2/assignment2_v2.ipynb). This version is functioning properly but need hyperparameters tuning for good performence. Note that resolution need to be reduced if multi-channel color images are used due to GPU memory.

Question 4: See [write up](https://github.com/stwklu/cmput617/blob/master/assignment2/question4_writeup.pdf)
